# Computer Vision Assignments

These are my solutions to the assignments for the computer vision class in SS2018 at TU Munich. All assignments are to be done in Matlab, using only its standard features.

## Assignment 1
The key objective for the first assignment was to make an implementation of the harris feature detector. This algorithm is commonly used to detect corners in pictures that are subsequently used for correspondence estimation between different pictures of the same scene.

## Assignment 2
The harris detector from assignment 1 provides us with a set of corner features for a given grayscale image. The aim for assignment 2 is to use two different pictures of the same scene (left and right point of views) and estimate feature affinity, based on the normalised cross correlation algorithm, in order two find pairs of corresponding features.

Finding corresponding pixels is the key for application of stereo algorithms, that enable three-dimensional computer vision.
