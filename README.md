# Computer Vision Assignments

These are my solutions to the assignments for the computer vision class in SS2018 at TU Munich. All assignments are to be done in Matlab, using only its standard features.

## Assignment 1
The key objective for the first assignment was to make an implementation of the harris feature detector. This algorithm is commonly used to detect corners in pictures that are subsequently used for correspondence estimation between different pictures of the same scene.
